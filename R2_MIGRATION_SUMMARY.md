- `covers/` - Cover images
- `groups/` - Group media files

### 🔗 URL Structure

**Before (MinIO):**
```
http://localhost:9000/post-media/posts/userId/filename.jpg
```

**After (R2):**
```
https://account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/social-app-storage/posts/userId/filename.jpg
```

**With Custom Domain:**
